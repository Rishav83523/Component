<ng-content select="icon> -> </ng-content> if ng content fails to show that thing in icon selector it will show the selector content.aur called as fallback content.

with input decorator no need to use ()  but with input signal we need to use input ()  because its a signal function.

for content selectors and ngcontent we can specify mutiple selectors seperated by commas.

:host allows us to apply css directly to rendered css element.


@HostBinding('class') className = 'control'
also we can use hostListener  we can listen to events on the host element

host:{
  (class) = 'onclick();
}

now just call the onCLick function


//we get programettic acess to elements like this .
private el = inject(ElementRef)

ngOnchanges is called when the input recieved changes
angular automaticllay produces changes object.

ngOnDestroy will be called just before the component is getting destroyed

ngDocheck is invoked by angular if it thinks there is some change is ui and this hook is called a lot so discouraged to use it more

Content vs view

view is its template
all elements inside are part of its view

content is any content projected into view with ngcontent
ngAFterContentinit if content is instialiszed

contentchecked when angular mechnism checks for some changes

its same for viewintit and viewchecked but for template

ngOnit is called after angular has intialized all data-bound properties


@viewChild helps us to find child element in that components template.
