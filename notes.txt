<ng-content select="icon> -> </ng-content> if ng content fails to show that thing in icon selector it will show the selector content.aur called as fallback content.

with input decorator no need to use ()  but with input signal we need to use input ()  because its a signal function.

for content selectors and ngcontent we can specify mutiple selectors seperated by commas.

:host allows us to apply css directly to rendered css element.
